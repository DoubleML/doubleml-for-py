    """
    This dgp mimics a production process where the yield of a production lot consisting of `K` individual items to be
    optimized. Each item is described by a 2D location on a plane. The initial datapoints for a lot are randomly sampled
    from a region specified by
    - `origin_shape` (either 'ellipsis' or 'rectangle', corresponding to gaussian or uniform distribution)
    - `origin_a`, `origin_b`: determining the range of the shape (for uniform distribution) or variance
      (for gaussian distribution) in the x and y directions.

    The goal is to move all the items of a lot into a target region. This region is specified through `target_center`,
    `target_a`, `target_b`, and `target_shape`, which have the same meaning as for the origin.

    Some production lots are already well at the beginning (they lie within target region), while others do not.
    This is modeled through a random placement of the center of the data points between the coordinate origin and the
    `target_center`. Additionally, `origin_perturbation` describes the magnitude of random shifts applied to the points
    in the orthogonal direction of the target vector.

    To improve the characteristics of a lot, an action can be issued that shifts the point cloud of the lot along the action
    vector `action_shift`. However, applying the action also induces some random perturbation effects on the points:
    - `action_scale`: expansion of the point cloud while maintaining its center
    - `action_perturbation`: magnitude of random perturbations applied to the `action_shift` vector
    - `action_drag_share` and `action_drag_scale`: some randomly selected points get dragged behind.

    The running variable `X` consists of two decision criteria:
      1. the mean distance from the target `X1`
      2. yield improvement `X2` estimated by the decision maker
    Note that the decision maker estimates the yield improvement by performing a hypothetical `action_shift` without
    perturbations on some selected lot items he measures (because of cost considerations, not all items in a lot might be
    measured). This is controlled by `running_mea_selection` (e.g., measure every k-th item).
    `running_dist_measure` controls the used distance measure for the first decision criterion. As the `action_shift` is
    fixed, the `euclidean` distance includes the orthogonal displacement of the target, whereas `projected` does not.

    Regarding the treatment, the following parameters are relevant:
    - `treatment_dist`: defines the cutoff for the distance criterion `X1`
    - `treatment_improvement`: defines the cutoff for the estimated yield improvement `X2`
    - `treatment_random_share`: some decision makers might defy this

    Note that defiers can also be caused by the partial information the decision maker has!
