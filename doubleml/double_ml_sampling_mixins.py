    Mixin class implementing sample splitting for DoubleML models.

    Notes
    -----
    The mixin class :class:`SampleSplittingMixin` implements the sample splitting procedure for DoubleML models.
    The sample splitting is drawn according to the attributes ``n_folds`` and ``n_rep``.
    If the data is clustered, the sample splitting is drawn such that clusters are not split across folds.
    For details, see the chapter on
    `sample splitting <https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/guide/resampling.html>`_ in the DoubleML user guide.

        Set the sample splitting for DoubleML models.

        The  attributes ``n_folds`` and ``n_rep`` are derived from the provided partition.

        Parameters
        ----------
        all_smpls : list or tuple
            If nested list of lists of tuples:
                The outer list needs to provide an entry per repeated sample splitting (length of list is set as
                ``n_rep``).
                The inner list needs to provide a tuple (train_ind, test_ind) per fold (length of list is set as
                ``n_folds``). test_ind must form a partition for each inner list.
            If list of tuples:
                The list needs to provide a tuple (train_ind, test_ind) per fold (length of list is set as
                ``n_folds``). test_ind must form a partition. ``n_rep=1`` is always set.
            If tuple:
                Must be a tuple with two elements train_ind and test_ind. Only viable option is to set
                train_ind and test_ind to np.arange(n_obs), which corresponds to no sample splitting.
                ``n_folds=1`` and ``n_rep=1`` is always set.

        all_smpls_cluster : list or None
            Nested list or ``None``. The first level of nesting corresponds to the number of repetitions. The second level
            of nesting corresponds to the number of folds. The third level of nesting contains a tuple of training and
            testing lists. Both training and testing contain an array for each cluster variable, which form a partition of
            the clusters.
            Default is ``None``.
